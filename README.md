# Beer_Challenge

Using the data of beer reviews, we want to explore the answers to questions that can be answered by ML and DS techniques.

I have used different statistical techniques to answer the questions and the process can be seen in src.ipynb notebook. We have a requirement.txt which will be used to setup the environment with required packages. Before you run the notebook to reproduce the results, it is advised to have the dataset (BeerDataScienceProject.csv) in the same folder as the notebook, but there is code in the notebook that will set it up even if you do not.
